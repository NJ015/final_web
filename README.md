Please note that we didn't use the github for the remaining part of the project as we faced technical issues plus merge conflicts.
After solving them we chose to put github and sourcetree aside to avoid having merging conflicts on the pull on the remaing 3 devices when we are already tight on time.
That is the reason why some functionalities were not updated on the bb version compared to final6.zip which doesn't have mvc either.
